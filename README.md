- pages/: Page Object

- types/: Types of variables

- utils/test-data.ts: Test data generators

- utils/env.ts: base URL

- utils/helpers.ts: Reusable functions

- playwright.config.ts: Configuration file


Step 5: Write a Testscript.

Step 6: Run Tests Locally: 

```
npx playwright test --headed
```

Step 7: Check report HTML file
```
npx playwright show-report
```

Step 7: Add GitHub Actions CI to run multiple job
- Edit package json file
```
